The psychological, emotional and social well-being of an individual determines their ability to contribute and function as a social member. Several studies over the years have proven that an alarming number of people live with mental illnesses, of which only a fraction is documented. Studies conducted by Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI) organization have indicated that these figures are much higher in the tech industry. We present an analysis of patterns and infer contributory factors for mental illness in the tech industry, to aid in the early detection and assess employeesâ€™ risk of diagnosis. Towards this end, the study comprises a detailed analysis, models for prediction of diagnosis, risk-based clustering and investigation into existing literature on factors contributing to mental illness. In addition to this, we have attempted to understand the impact of Covid-19 through analyzing trends of the factors influencing mental health, pre- and post-pandemic. We conclude with an insight to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global mental health and the actions taken in the workplace to mitigate this.
