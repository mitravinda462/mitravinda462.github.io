I worked under Prof. Mamatha HR in devising a framework that can help mitigate the challenge faced by
the law enforcement in accurately identifying faces of criminals through forensic sketches or mugshot
photos. My research led me to discern the need to build a framework which is inclusive of skin and hair
colors of the face-photos. I devised separate frameworks to convert face-sketches to face-photos and
vice-versa. 
1. Face-sketch synthesis framework

I used image processing methodologies like 2 scale image decomposition and bilateral
filtering to convert photos to sketches. 
2. Face-photo synthesis framework
I used the face-sketch synthesis module to generate a face-sketch
database of the existing face-photo database, ‘CelebA’. I trained a 9 layered Convolutional Neural
Network model to convert sketches to photos. 

3. Face recognition
I finally used Linear Discriminant Analysis to perform
facial recognition on face-photos and face-sketches. The framework also took care of variations like
different skin tones and hair colors, absence of hair, presence of beard, mustache or spectacles. In addition
to the statistical evaluation metrics like Feature Similarity Index Measure, Structural Similarity Index
Measure, Universal image Quality Index, I conducted an online survey to rate the similarity between the
original and generated images, thus capturing the human visual similarity perception.
