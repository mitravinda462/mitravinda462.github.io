Design features: 
* Input layer: Has 8 neurons
* Hidden layers: There are two hidden layers. The first has 4 neurons while the second has 5
* Output layer: has one neuron
* Activation function used: sigmoid
* Perhaps the most profound feature of our implementation is the that all our preprocessing was based on scientifically validated facts and correlation between parameters
