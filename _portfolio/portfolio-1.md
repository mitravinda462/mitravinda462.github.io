 The purpose of this software requirement specification is to provide a clear, documented model of
 the requirements for the online shopping system. This document serves to provide top level use
 cases for a web customer making purchases online. The system includes the client subsystem as
 well the seller subsystem.
 The online shopping system provides a platform for conducting sales of a wide variety of goods
 across the globe. It is implemented as an internet based enterprise and has a vast inventory of
 products from books, houseware, electronics, groceries and much more.
 Sellers use this system to easily expand their service to a more global platform. This guarantees
 better flexibility, larger audience and an improved market.
 The appeal of online shopping systems experienced a large boost in the last decade because the
 customers can browse easily through various options, brands and price ranges with very little
 hassle. The ability to reap its benefits from the comfort of oneâ€™s own home has only bolstered its
 claim as one of the biggest enterprises that dominates the internet.
