It is a simple implementation a travel planner using graph data structure. This program supports the following functions:

1. Creation of an undirected graph with destination names as nodes and time of travel between destinations as weights of the edges.
2. Addition of a new destination.
3. Addition of a new edge between 2 destinations.
4. Calculation of the shortest paths from a source to all destinations using Djikstra's algorithm.
5. Calculation of minimum spanning tree using Prim's algorithm.
