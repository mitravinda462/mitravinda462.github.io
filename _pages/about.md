As trivial as it may sound, my first impactful interaction with technology was when I got to hold a smartphone as a middle school student and it surely did make me feel like a 'cool kid'! Years down the lane, with broadened views and a variety of experiences in technology and Computer Science, technology now means to me a universe of opportunities – those that can drive the world's development, lead to new questions and solutions, provide access to information and most importantly facilitate individuals’ self-development. 

I am a zealous tech enthusiast and a graduate student pursuing Master's in Computer Science at University of Illinois at Chicago. I did my Bachelor's in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning and Data Science at PES University, India. I also interned at IBM for 6 months and worked full-time as a System Performance Analyst at IBM India System Development Labs in the Linux System Performance team. My interest lies in Software Development, Machine Learning, Data Science and Data Analytics. I'm passionate about solving problems and designing well rounded solutions. I'm a fast learner and I constantly try to improve my knowledge and skills. 

In my free time, I love to dance. I often find myself in front of a mirror, learning and exploring different dance forms - from old school hip-hop to contemporary and paso doble! I also enjoy reading books, painting and swimming. I am open for discussions on technology and of course, chats on dance, art or books! 

P.S I am beach person and a potterhead. My latest read was 'The Alchemist' by Paulo Coelho. It is an engaging and thought provoking story that allowed me to process the thoughts behind my goals through the Alchemist's perspective!
